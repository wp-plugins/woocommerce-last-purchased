This is the WooCommerce Last Purchased repository on GitHub. Here you can browse the source, look at open issues and keep track of development.

## About this plugin

This is WooCommerce plugin. It shows last purchased date on each product page.

## Why would I show this to my customers?

From my experience, showing last purchased date can increase conversion rate. This trick is using by Allegro ([www.allegro.pl](http://allegro.pl)), biggest auction and sales website in Poland.

## Support

This repository is not suitable for support. Please don't use the issue tracker for support requests, but for source code issues only. Support can take place in the [public support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-last-purchased) on WordPress.org, where the community can help each other out.

## Usage

### Basic usage

Just install plugin and you are ready to go.

### Using just date in your theme (and hide popup if needed)

So you want to get last purchased date somewhere in your theme files? No problem.

#### First way: using WooCommerce hooks

In you function.php file paste below code.

```php
function show_last_purchased_date(){

	if ( WLP()->last_purchased_date() ){
		echo '<div class="last-purchased-date">' . WLP()->last_purchased_text()
		        . ': ' . WLP()->last_purchased_date() . '</div>';
	}

}
add_action('woocommerce_product_meta_end', 'show_last_purchased_date');
```

For more information about WooCommerce hooks, please visit [WooCommerce documentation](http://docs.woothemes.com/document/introduction-to-hooks-actions-and-filters/).

#### Second way: override WooCommerce template

You can achieve exact same result by overriding WooCommerce templates.

You will need to override one of WooCommerce templates. In this case we will put this information right after Add to cart button and SKU.

For more information about this, please visit [WooCommerce documentation](http://docs.woothemes.com/document/template-structure/).

1. Go to your woocommerce plugin directory.
2. Go to `templates` directory.
3. Go to `single-product`.
4. Copy `meta.php` file to 'your_theme_directory/woocommerce/single-product/'.
5. If you don't have such directory, create it.
6. Now add below code just before `<?php do_action( 'woocommerce_product_meta_end' ); ?>`


```php
<?php if ( WLP()->last_purchased_date() ): ?>

    <div class="last-purchased-date">
        <?php echo WLP()->last_purchased_text(); ?>:
        <?php echo WLP()->last_purchased_date(); ?>
    </div>

<?php endif; ?>
```

#### Don't show popup

In your functions.php:

```php
function hide_wlp_popup(){

	WLP()->hide_popup = true;

}
add_action('before_wlp_init', 'hide_wlp_popup');
```

## Styling

You can override popup styles. Just place your rules in your theme `style.css` file. Couple examples below.

### Display popup in bottom left corner instead of bottom right

```css
.wlp-popup{

    left: 15px;
    right: auto;
    margin-right: 15px;

}
```

### Change background and text color

```css
.wlp-popup{

	background: rgba(98,233,219,0.9);
    color:#0b413b;

}
```

### Remove rounded corners, non-transparent background, no X button

```css
.wlp-popup{

	background: #76234c;
	border-radius: 0;

}

.wlp-popup-close{

    display:none;

}
```

## Translations

This plugin is translation ready. You can help by translating this plugin into your language. All languages are stored in `languages` directory.

### `Time ago` text translation.

This plugin uses [timeago.js](https://github.com/rmm5t/jquery-timeago) jQuery plugin. This plugin is also ready for translations. You can find all available languages [here](https://github.com/rmm5t/jquery-timeago/tree/master/locales). If your language is not available in `timeago.js` plugin, you will need to create such translation as well.

## TODO List

This plugin is free, and I have got limited time. However I will try to implement following features in near future:

* Add options to WordPress admin area:
    * show/hide close button,
    * popup appear settings,
    * custom css field,
* Ability to override popup html to your own.
